# Main Process Refactoring Plan

## Current Issues

1. **Inconsistent Directory Structure**: Multiple initialization-related directories (`initialization/`, `initializer/`, `main-app-loader.ts`) with unclear responsibilities
2. **Service Location Confusion**: Services are split between `core/services/` and `services/` at the root level
3. **Configuration Management**: `app-config.ts` is too large (322 lines) and handles multiple responsibilities
4. **Plugin System Integration**: Plugin system could be better integrated with the core architecture
5. **IPC Module Organization**: IPC modules could benefit from better categorization and organization

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Reduce file sizes and improve code organization
3. **Better Type Safety**: Enhance TypeScript usage and type definitions
4. **Consistent Architecture**: Apply consistent patterns across all modules
5. **Improved Documentation**: Better inline documentation and type definitions

## Current Status

The refactoring has been implemented, with the following key changes:

1. ✅ **Reorganized Directory Structure**: Restructured according to the proposed plan
2. ✅ **Improved Core Modules**: Core modules have been reorganized into appropriate subdirectories
3. ✅ **Enhanced Plugin System**: Plugin system now has a clearer organization with core/manager separation
4. ✅ **Better IPC Architecture**: IPC system has been improved with clear component responsibilities
5. ✅ **Storage System Refinement**: Storage system now has a more consistent structure

## Completed Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Restructuring ✅

1. Created new directory structure
2. Moved and refactored configuration management
3. Consolidated initialization logic
4. Reorganized core services

### Phase 2: IPC System Enhancement ✅

1. Reorganized IPC modules by domain
2. Enhanced type definitions
3. Improved error handling
4. Updated documentation

### Phase 3: Plugin System Integration ✅

1. Reorganized plugin system
2. Improved plugin lifecycle management
3. Enhanced plugin type definitions
4. Updated plugin documentation

### Phase 4: Storage System Refinement ✅

1. Reorganized storage layer
2. Improved repository pattern implementation
3. Enhanced type safety
4. Updated storage documentation

### Phase 5: Documentation and Testing ✅

1. Updated all documentation
2. Added/updated unit tests
3. Added integration tests
4. Created migration guide

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Type Safety First**: All new code must be fully typed
2. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests for new/modified code
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing APIs where possible
5. **Incremental Changes**: Make changes in small, testable increments

## Migration Strategy

1. **Parallel Implementation**: New structure will be implemented alongside existing code
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to control new implementations
3. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate features one at a time
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing at each stage
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation as changes are made

## Success Criteria

1. **Code Quality**:
   - Reduced file sizes (no file > 200 lines)
   - Improved type coverage
   - Better test coverage
   - Clearer documentation

2. **Performance**:
   - No degradation in startup time
   - No degradation in IPC performance
   - No degradation in plugin loading

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Clearer module boundaries
   - Better separation of concerns
   - More consistent patterns
   - Better documentation

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - Easier to add new features
   - Better type hints and autocompletion
   - Clearer error messages
   - Better debugging experience
